Hi there, I'm Henry!
=============================================================================================================================

A creative Cloud Engineer with a passion for building secure, scalable, and efficient cloud infrastructures. My journey began in system administration, where I honed my skills in managing on-premises and virtualized environments. Over time, I discovered the power of cloud technologies and transitioned into AWS and automation.

I specialize in creating CI/CD pipelines, automating workflows, and optimizing infrastructure using tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. I have documented my recent projects below, so feel free to check it out.

As I continue to grow in this dynamic field, I’m committed to continuous learning and innovation. If you’re interested in discussing cloud solutions or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!

Thanks for visiting, and let’s build something amazing!
