### Hi there 👋

<!--
**HenryMark01/HenryMark01** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
👋 Hello there! I'm a Junior Cloud Engineer with a knack for deploying and managing infrastructure using AWS services. 💻 My expertise lies in AWS offerings like CloudWatch, S3, DynamoDB, VPC, EC2, IAM Users & Roles, Lambda, and serverless architecture. 🚀

I'm well-versed in Linux, with a background in networking and computer communication engineering, which gives me a solid foundation in understanding complex systems. 🌐

Recently, I graduated from the AWS re/Start program, where I obtained my Cloud Practitioner certificate, further solidifying my skills and knowledge in cloud technologies. ☁️ Excited to collaborate and contribute to innovative projects in the cloud space! 🌟
